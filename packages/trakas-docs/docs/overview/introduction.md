## What is Trakas?

> /**ËˆtrakÉ™s**/ â€” It comes from a name of _Poseidon's assistant_: Althea **Trakas**
>
> This is JavaScript Utilities. As we hope it will be a useful assistant for Javascript's developers, like an _assistant of the gods_.

In any Javascript projects we've ever done, we realized that there are some _pieces of code_ that we have to write down
over and over again through all kinds of web app. Do you know what it is?

> Common code (snippets)
>
> [Snippet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)>) is a programming term for a small region of re-usable
> source code, machine code, or text.
> Ordinarily, these are formally defined operative units to incorporate into larger programming modules.
> Snippet management is a feature of some text editors, program source code editors, IDEs, and related software.

So we decide to write it here, since we know that we have a better place for reference, and it will enhance the usability.

## Why Trakas, not some "Google works"?

In the beginning, We feel they are too small to be a package, just take some "Google works" to find them out,
but now we think it should be a package for better reasons:

1. A better place for reference
1. Enhance the usability
1. We can customize them with our own ideas to make them better.
1. Our packages will stay with the high standard of quality.

We create basic snippets as we do in our real-life projects. When Trakas becomes a good foundation, then we will have something more significant with it.

:::tip Any ideas?
If you have **any ideas or improvement**, pull requests will be welcomed. When you've ever seen something you have to
write it **over and over again**. Just tell us, then you have to write it only one time. ðŸ˜‰
